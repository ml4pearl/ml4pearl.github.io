title: ML4PEARL
subtitle: Machine Learning 4 Political Economy and Race Lab
---
The ML4PEARL research group brings together faculty and undergraduate students to develop critical and creative approaches to advance questions of race and political economy. By removing traditional disciplinary boundaries, this group aims to rethink and repurpose machine learning models to explore socio-economic inequalities and produce compelling research with broad societal impact. 

We are motivated by current scholarship on the interplay between race and technology and criticisms of the ill-advised adaptation of technological tools to social problems; and we are inspired by the scholars who are reimagining technological tools for remediation of the systemic inequalities.

We are broadly interested in leveraging the underlying structure of data to improve and interpret learning outcomes of neural network models. Interpretable models provide an opportunity to affirm or deny existing hypotheses; garner additional insights and inspire new hypotheses.
